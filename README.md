# kivygainztracker

Author: JustVinny 

GainZ Tracker is a simple GUI made with Python and the Kivy framework optimised for android devices.

This provides you with an easy way to track your lifting progress in the gym in between your sets. 

Current features:

  1.) There are 3 buttons in the main menu - Update Stats, Current Stats, and Exit.
  
  2.) Update Stats lets you update your lifting stats by accessing and writing to a csv file.
  
  3.) Current Stats gives you an overview of all your lifts by reading from a csv file.
  
Latest updates:

  1.) Added input validation for Update Stats by making sure the user only uses digits and a maximum of 3 characters.
  
  2.) Changed the font colors for status bar for input validation. Green = Success and Red = Error.
  
Planned future features:

  1.) Will add a feature at some point that lets the user edit the exercises list to cater their specific needs.
  
  2.) Will most likely add scrolled view for select exercises within Update Window just in case a user adds too many exercises. 
  
  3.) Will most likely do the same as the previous number for Current Exercises as well due to the same reasons stated above.
  
Feature ideas that might not be implemented soon:

  1.) Make a graphical representation of your progress. Probably will use matplotlib for this one, so I will have to learn that.
  
  2.) Add a feature that will let you save your stats by date so we can plot a graph with the data.
  
  3.) if implementing the previous number, will most likely need to learn some SQL for more efficient data handling.
